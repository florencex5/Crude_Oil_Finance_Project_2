## Collaborative Action Points for different stakeholders
1. **Oil Companies**
   * *Mitigating "artificial" Tail Risk for a Better Economy Stability*
      * Oil companies must proactively address "artificial" tail risks, such as sudden supply chain changes, to ensure a stable economy. The 2023 instances of OPEC announcing oil production cuts underscore the importance of mitigating oil price volatility. Adjusting supply amounts is recognized as suboptimal for addressing both short-term profitability concerns and long-term development challenges, including navigating the energy transition and managing stress from potential "stranded assets." 
      * Based on my prior crude oil spot pricing model utilizing supply side data such as weekly refiner and blender production, the R-squared (R2) value surpassing 90% attests to the model's accuracy. This high precision indicates the significance of quality input data, demonstrating that over 90% of the variability in weekly crude oil WTI prices can be reliably accounted for.
   * *Redefining Short-term Profitability in the Context of the Energy Transition*
      * Moreover, short-term profitability, as reflected in metrics like total revenue on financial statements, should not be considered as one of benchmark for evaluating oil company performance -- especially in the context of the ongoing energy transition. Rather than viewing the current decline in profits as a loss, it should be taken as strategic investments addressing the consequences of past actions impacting our environment and planning for a more sustainable future.
   * *Advocating Transparency in Oil Production Scheduling*
      * While a collusive pricing strategy remains characteristic of an oligopoly market, adapting to changes in the current climate, where energy types can be renewed, prompts a reconsideration of pricing strategies. A potential transition to a more transparent pricing phase is essential for fostering market trust and aligning with sustainable development goals.For instance, OPEC, as the dominant organization in Petroleum Exporting, could consider to provide a quarterly schedule of oil production. This proactive approach aims to enhance market stability and facilitate strategic planning for oil companies and stakeholders alike. 
    
2. **Automakers**
   * *Strategic Collaboration for Hydrogen Vehicle Introduction*
      * Top vehicle companies should consider strategic alliances to collectively introduce hydrogen vehicles, recognizing the pivotal role of customer acceptance in driving sales and facilitating a seamless energy transition. This collaborative effort will harness the combined branding power to enhance public awareness and acceptance of hydrogen as a viable new energy vehicle option.
      * Despite the current surge in sales for Toyota hybrid vehicles, it is crucial to understand that this success is not only indicative of future automaker's "profitability" but also shows a lack of awareness among customers regarding the environmental impact of different vehicle types. This could points to a general lack of confidence in new energy-powered vehicles, such as electric vehicles and hydrogen models. Addressing this knowledge gap becomes paramount in steering consumers towards sustainable choices.
   * *Joint Funding for Research and Development(R&D)*
      * Drawing from Coe and Helpman's (1995) insights, emphasize the positive impact of foreign R&D efforts on domestic productivity. Pooling R&D investments from leading automakers is essential due to the substantial funding it provides, far surpassing individual capacities. This collaborative source could unite diverse professionals in the auto industry. Adopting a joint approach to technology innovation is more efficient for addressing the challenges posed by the current climate environment.The intricacies of hydrogen infrastructure development highlight the necessity for collaborative efforts in solving complexities.
