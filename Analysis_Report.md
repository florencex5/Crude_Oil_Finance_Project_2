## Collaborative Action Points for Different Stakeholders
1. **Oil Companies**
   * *Mitigating "Artificial" Tail Risk for The Better Economic Stability*
      * Oil companies must proactively address "artificial" tail risks, such as sudden supply chain changes, to ensure a stable economy. The 2023 instances of OPEC announcing oil production cuts underscore the importance of mitigating oil price volatility. Adjusting supply amounts is recognized as suboptimal for addressing both short-term profitability concerns and long-term development challenges, including navigating the energy transition and managing stress from potential "stranded assets." 
      * Based on my prior crude oil spot pricing model utilizing supply side data such as weekly refiner and blender production, the R-squared (R2) value surpassing 90% attests to the model's accuracy. This high precision indicates the significance of quality input data, demonstrating that over 90% of the variability in weekly crude oil WTI prices can be reliably accounted for.
   * *Redefining Short-term Profitability in the Context of the Energy Transition*
      * Moreover, short-term profitability, as reflected in metrics like total revenue on financial statements, should not be considered as one of benchmark for evaluating oil company performance -- especially in this ongoing energy transition. Rather than viewing the current decline in profits as a loss, it should be taken as strategic investments addressing the consequences of past actions impacting our environment and planning for a more sustainable future.
   * *Advocating Transparency in Oil Production Scheduling*
      * While a collusive pricing strategy remains characteristic of an oligopoly market, adapting to changes in the current climate, where energy types can be renewed, prompts a reconsideration of pricing strategies. A potential transition to a more transparent pricing phase is essential for fostering market trust and aligning with sustainable development goals.For instance, OPEC, as the dominant organization in Petroleum Exporting, could consider to provide a quarterly schedule of oil production. This proactive approach aims to enhance market stability and facilitate strategic planning for oil companies and stakeholders alike. 
    
2. **Automakers**
   * *Strategic Collaboration for Hydrogen Vehicle Introduction*
      * Top vehicle companies should consider strategic alliances to collectively introduce hydrogen vehicles, recognizing the pivotal role of customer acceptance in driving sales and facilitating a seamless energy transition. The collaborative effort will harness the combined branding power to enhance public awareness and acceptance of hydrogen as a viable new energy vehicle option.
      * Despite the current surge in sales for Toyota hybrid vehicles, it is crucial to understand that this success is not only indicative of future automaker's "profitability" but also shows a lack of awareness among customers regarding the environmental impact of different vehicle types. This could points to a general lack of confidence in new energy-powered vehicles, such as electric vehicles and hydrogen models. Addressing this knowledge gap becomes paramount in steering consumers towards sustainable choices.
   * *Joint Funding for Research and Development(R&D)*
      * Drawing from Coe and Helpman's (1995) insights, emphasize the positive impact of foreign R&D efforts on domestic productivity. Pooling R&D investments from leading automakers is economical due to the substantial funding it provides, far surpassing individual capacities. This shared source could unite diverse professionals in the auto industry. Adopting a joint approach to technology innovation is more efficient for addressing the challenges posed by the current climate environment.The intricacies of hydrogen infrastructure development highlight the necessity for collaborative efforts in solving complexities.
    
3. **Government**
   * *Taking the Leadership for Efficient Hydrogen Infrastructure*
      * Government could consider to take the leadership role in facilitating collaboration between oil companies and automakers to fortify the development of hydrogen infrastructure. In diverse transportation sectors, Maersk has initiated methanol-powered vessels, and the International Air Transportation Association is also advancing towards zero-emission hydrogen airplanes.
      * Hydrogen transition complexities vary across shipping, aviation, and automotive industries, presenting potential higher challenges for the automotive sector based on current available technology:
        1) Auto hydrogen infrastructure is more decentralized and intricate compared to aviation (centralized at airports) and shipping (sea-based)
        2) The hydrogen infrastructure for autos entails higher risks due to its direct impact on people, occurring with greater frequency, contrasting the less risk-intensive goods transport in shipping.
      * Beyond the complexities in constructing the auto industry's hydrogen infrastructure, conflicting interests between oil companies and traditional automakers need government intervention. The government's role is important in mitigating climate-related risks (E.g. transition risk) and fostering a collaborative approach to address industry-specific challenges.
      * **Pros of Government Intervention:**
        * Mitigate adverse effects of "unilateral" announcements (E.g., "Zero-emission plans," "EV mandate sales") to ensure a balanced transition, considering both demand and practical supply chain plans for automakers (E.g., providing employees required training skills for a smooth energy transition).
        * Recognize that investing in infrastructure offers protection against inflation, presenting a proactive and practical approach to avoid unnecessary market volatility, rather than planning for an "uncertain" soft landing economy.

4. **Cross-Boarder Organizations**
   * *Enhancing Global Collaboration among cross-boarder organizations (E.g. EU,IMF,UN,OPEC,etc.)*
      * In pursuit of a more coordinated and effective response to pressing global climate change challenges, it is significantly important to foster proactive collaboration among multilateral institutions. The current IMF research report, "Unlocking Climate Finance in Asia-Pacific," mentioned that *"Multilateral institutions must collaborate to facilitate peer-to-peer learning across countries."* 
      * This collaborative approach could help to not only addresses the disparities between developed and developing countries but also mitigates potential geopolitical risks, achieving a more cohesive global strategy.Reference the pan-European hydrogen network published by the EU in 2023 as an exemplary model of effective cooperations, showcasing the power of collaboration in tackling climate change.
   * *Increasing Meeting Frequencies for Sector-Specific Focus (e.g. Transportation)*
      * Greenhouse gas emissions has daily occurrences, it is necessary to consider a higher frequency of meetings, particularly for sectors with significant environmental impact, such as transportation. For instance, in the US, where 79.2% of greenhouse gas emissions stem from CO2, and the transportation sector accounts for 28% of total emissionsâ€”making is the highest-polluting sector.
      * While the UN Climate Conferences (COP) provide an annual official platform for global discourse, but there is a myriad of issues and topics demanding attention, with "the phase-out of fossil fuels" emerging as one of the most hotly debated topics at the current COP28. In light of these complexities and volume, increasing meeting frequencies is productive for addressing evolving challenges more promptly.
