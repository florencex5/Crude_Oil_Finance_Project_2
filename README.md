2. [Exploring the US EV Industry Through the US Bicycle Sharing System](https://github.com/florencex5/EV_and_Bicycle.git)
3. **Collaborative Action Points for the Auto Industry Sustainable Development**


## Key Findings
- The noticeable lack of *collaboration and interconnectivity* among various stakeholders impedes efficient progress, subsequently hindering the sustainable growth of the auto industry. If addressing climate change is genuinely a universally acknowledged concern, it's time to foster collaboration across sectors and pave the way for impactful and sustainable development in the auto industry, as well as a more feasible hydrogen economy.
